•  Courier status analysis revealed that delayed or cancelled shipments were less common in specific categories, highlighting potential logistic bottlenecks.

•  Product size influenced quantity trends, with smaller-sized products often having higher sales volumes.

•  The state-wise quantity map clearly identified key geographic areas driving Amazon's order volume.

•  Most orders were in the “delivered” or “shipped” status, but there was a noticeable rate of returns/cancellations in select categories.

•  Order amounts varied week-over-week, with peaks typically aligning with promotional events or high-demand periods in specific categories.
